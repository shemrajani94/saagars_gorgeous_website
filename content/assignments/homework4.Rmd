# The Bechdel Test

https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/

The [Bechdel test](https://bechdeltest.com) is a way to assess how women are depicted in Hollywood movies.  In order for a movie to pass the test:

1. It has to have at least two [named] women in it
2. Who talk to each other
3. About something besides a man

There is a nice article and analysis you can find here https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-dollar-and-cents-case-against-hollywoods-exclusion-of-women/
We have a sample of 1394 movies and we want to fit a model to predict whether a film passes the test or not.

```{r read_data}

bechdel <- read_csv(here::here("content/data", "bechdel.csv")) %>% 
  mutate(test = factor(test)) 
glimpse(bechdel)

```
How many films fail/pass the test, both as a number and as a %?

```{r}
  bechdel %>%
    group_by(test) %>% 
    summarise(test_count = n()) %>% 
    mutate(test_pct = test_count/nrow(bechdel) *100) %>% 
    filter(test == 'Pass')
```


## Movie scores
```{r}
ggplot(data = bechdel, aes(
  x = metascore,
  y = imdb_rating,
  colour = test
)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .3, size = 3) +
  scale_colour_manual(values = c("tomato", "olivedrab")) +
  labs(
    x = "Metacritic score",
    y = "IMDB rating",
    colour = "Bechdel test"
  ) +
 theme_light()
```


# Split the data
```{r}
# **Split the data**

set.seed(123)

data_split <- initial_split(bechdel, # updated data
                           prop = 0.8, 
                           strata = test)

bechdel_train <- training(data_split) 
bechdel_test <- testing(data_split)
```

Check the counts and % (proportions) of the `test` variable in each set.
```{r}
count_bechdel <- function(bechdel_df){
  bechdel_df %>%
    group_by(test) %>% 
    summarise(test_count = n()) %>% 
    mutate(test_pct = test_count/nrow(bechdel_df) *100) %>% 
    filter(test == 'Pass')
}

count_bechdel(bechdel_train)
count_bechdel(bechdel_test)


```

## Feature exploration

## Any outliers? 

```{r}

bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore) %>% 

    pivot_longer(cols = 2:6,
               names_to = "feature",
               values_to = "value") %>% 
  ggplot()+
  aes(x=test, y = value, fill = test)+
  coord_flip()+
  geom_boxplot()+
  facet_wrap(~feature, scales = "free")+
  theme_bw()+
  theme(legend.position = "none")+
  labs(x=NULL,y = NULL)

```

## Scatterplot - Correlation Matrix

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
bechdel %>% 
  select(test, budget_2013, domgross_2013, intgross_2013, imdb_rating, metascore)%>% 
  ggpairs(aes(colour=test), alpha=0.2)+
  theme_bw()
```

```{=html}
<span style="color: red;">
    <p>Movies that fail the Bechdel test tend to have higher median ratings. The entire box plot is shifted further to the right. This same trend exists with metascore ratings, but the difference in rating is smaller.</p>
    <p>Movies that fail the Bechdel test also tend to have higher budgets than those that pass.</p>
</span>
```

## Categorical variables

Write a paragraph discussing the output of the following 
```{r}
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(genre, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
  
 
bechdel %>% 
  group_by(rated, test) %>%
  summarise(n = n()) %>% 
  mutate(prop = n/sum(n))
```
```{=html}
<span style="color: red;">
    <p>Action and animation movies have a lower proportion of movies that pass the test, compared to the whole sample.</p>
    <p>Adventure and Biography movies have a similar proportion pass rate to the whole sample.</p>
    <p>Comedy movies have an above average pass rate for the test, compared to the sample.</p>
</span>
```


# Train first models. `test ~ metascore + imdb_rating`

  broom::tidy()

lr_preds <- lr_fit %>%
  augment(new_data = bechdel_train) %>%
  mutate(.pred_match = if_else(test == .pred_Pass, 1, 0))

```

### Confusion matrix

  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>% 
  autoplot(type = "heatmap")


```


## Decision Tree

```

```{r}
tree_preds %>% 
  conf_mat(truth = test, estimate = .pred_class) %>%

```

## Draw the decision tree

draw_tree <- 
    rpart::rpart(
        test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
        data = bechdel_train, # uses data that contains both birth weight and `low`
        control = rpart::rpart.control(maxdepth = 5, cp = 0, minsplit = 10)
    ) %>% 
    partykit::as.party()

```

# Cross Validation

Run the code below. What does it return?

```{r}
set.seed(123)
bechdel_folds <- vfold_cv(data = bechdel_train, 
                          v = 3, 
                          strata = test)
bechdel_folds
```
```{=html}
<span style="color: red;">
    <p>This function returns a dictionary-like data structure with id and split for each cross validation split</p>
</span>
```

## `fit_resamples()`

Trains and tests a resampled model.

```{r}
lr_fit <- lr_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )


tree_fit <- tree_mod %>%
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating,
    resamples = bechdel_folds
  )
```


## `collect_metrics()`

Unnest the metrics column from a tidymodels `fit_resamples()`
```{r}

collect_metrics(lr_fit)
collect_metrics(tree_fit)


```


```{r}
tree_preds <- tree_mod %>% 
  fit_resamples(
    test ~ metascore + imdb_rating, 
    resamples = bechdel_folds,
    control = control_resamples(save_pred = TRUE) #<<
  )

# What does the data for ROC look like?
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail)  

# Draw the ROC
tree_preds %>% 
  collect_predictions() %>% 
  roc_curve(truth = test, .pred_Fail) %>% 
  autoplot()

```


# Build a better training set with `recipes`

## Preprocessing options

- Encode categorical predictors
- Center and scale variables
- Handle class imbalance
- Impute missing data
- Perform dimensionality reduction 
- ... ...

## To build a recipe

1. Start the `recipe()`
1. Define the variables involved
1. Describe **prep**rocessing [step-by-step]

## Collapse Some Categorical Levels

Do we have any `genre` with few observations?  Assign genres that have less than 3% to a new category 'Other'


```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel %>% 
  count(genre) %>% 
  mutate(genre = fct_reorder(genre, n)) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = genre, 
             y = n)) +
  geom_col(alpha = .8) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = NULL) +
  geom_hline(yintercept = (nrow(bechdel_train)*.03), lty = 3)+
  theme_light()


#Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi have fewer than 3% of share
```


```{r}
movie_rec <-
  recipe(test ~ .,
         data = bechdel_train) %>%
  
  # Genres with less than 5% will be in a catewgory 'Other'
    step_other(genre, threshold = .03) 
```
  

## Before recipe

```{r}
#| echo = FALSE
bechdel_train %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```


## After recipe

```{r}
movie_rec %>% 
  prep() %>% 
  bake(new_data = bechdel_train) %>% 
  count(genre, sort = TRUE)
```

## `step_dummy()`

Converts nominal data into numeric dummy variables

```{r}
#| results = "hide"
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

movie_rec 
```

## Let's think about the modelling 

What if there were no films with `rated` NC-17 in the training data?

-  Will the model have a coefficient for `rated` NC-17?
-  What will happen if the test data includes a film with `rated` NC-17?


## `step_novel()`

Adds a catch-all level to a factor for any new values not encountered in model training, which lets R intelligently predict new levels in the test set.

```{r}

movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal_predictors) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal_predictors()) 

```


## `step_zv()`

Intelligently handles zero variance variables (variables that contain only a single value)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes()) 
  
```


## `step_normalize()`

Centers then scales numeric variable (mean = 0, sd = 1)

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 

```


## `step_corr()`

Removes highly correlated variables

```{r}
movie_rec <- recipe(test ~ ., data = bechdel) %>%
  step_other(genre, threshold = .03) %>% 
  step_novel(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% # Use *before* `step_dummy()` so new level is dummified
  step_dummy(all_nominal(), -all_outcomes()) %>% 
  step_zv(all_numeric(), -all_outcomes())  %>% 
  step_normalize(all_numeric()) 
##%>% 
  ##step_corr(all_predictors(), threshold = 0.75, method = "spearman") 



movie_rec
```


# Define different models to fit

```{r}
## Model Building

# 1. Pick a `model type`
# 2. set the `engine`
# 3. Set the `mode`: regression or classification

# Logistic regression
log_spec <-  logistic_reg() %>%  # model type
  set_engine(engine = "glm") %>%  # model engine
  set_mode("classification") # model mode

# Show your model specification
log_spec

# Decision Tree
tree_spec <- decision_tree() %>%
  set_engine(engine = "C5.0") %>%
  set_mode("classification")

tree_spec

# Random Forest
library(ranger)

rf_spec <- 
  rand_forest() %>% 
  set_engine("ranger", importance = "impurity") %>% 
  set_mode("classification")


# Boosted tree (XGBoost)
library(xgboost)

xgb_spec <- 
  boost_tree() %>% 
  set_engine("xgboost") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 

# K-nearest neighbour (k-NN)
knn_spec <- 
  nearest_neighbor(neighbors = 4) %>% # we can adjust the number of neighbors 
  set_engine("kknn") %>% 
  set_mode("classification") 
```


# Bundle recipe and model with `workflows`


```{r}
log_wflow <- # new workflow object
 workflow() %>% # use workflow function
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>%   # use the new recipe
 add_model(log_spec)   # add your model spec

# show object
log_wflow


## A few more workflows

tree_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(tree_spec) 

rf_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(rf_spec) 

xgb_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(xgb_spec)

knn_wflow <-
 workflow() %>%
 add_recipe(movie_rec) %>% 
 add_model(knn_spec)

```

HEADS UP

1. How many models have you specified?
2. What's the difference between a model specification and a workflow?
3. Do you need to add a formula (e.g., `test ~ .`)  if you have a recipe?
